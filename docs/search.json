What is most important to me is that you are first and foremost healthy and able to participate to the course, and that you succeed and get the most out of the course.\nIt is OK not to be OK, and remember that you are not alone. Other people, teachers and students, might be struggling right now or have struggled before and might have gone through what you are going through now. Remember that support exists for you, so please do reach out. If you see somebody close to you struggling, please let them know about the available support network and encourage them to reach out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\n\nYou can reach Stefano at s.coretta@ed.ac.uk or on Teams.\nIf you want to book office hours with Stefano, you can do so here: https://bit.ly/33BH84L."

    "text": "2 R packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you have previously installed the C++ toolkit, CmdStan and/or cmdstanr, or if you have recently updated your OS, please follow these instructions to reinstall them.\n\n\nNow you will need to install a few packages and extra software.\nHere is an overview of what you will install:\n\nC++ toolchain.\nR packages: tidyverse, remotes, cmdstanr, brms.\nCmdStan (including Stan).\n\n\n2.1 Install the C++ toolchain\nSome of the software (CmdStan) used in the workshops require a working C++ toolchain for compilation.\nYou can find information on how to set up the C++ toolchain in Section 1.2.1 of the CmdStan User’s Guide.\nMake sure to follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n2.2 Install the R packages\nAfter you have installed the C++ toolchain, you need to install the following R packages. Run the following in the Console.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software or update existing packages or software, please do so. In all cases, carefully read the message in the Console or in a pop-up window: they always tell you what to do or the options you have.\n\n\n2.3 Install CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\nIt will take several minutes and you will see a lot of text flashing in the Console.\n\n\n2.4 Check your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console.\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nfile &lt;- file.path(cmdstan_path(), \"examples\", \"bernoulli\", \"bernoulli.stan\")\nmod &lt;- cmdstan_model(file, force_recompile = TRUE)\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = 10, y = c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))\nfit &lt;- mod$sample(\n  data = data_list, \n  seed = 123, \n  chains = 4, \n  parallel_chains = 4,\n  refresh = 500 # print update every 500 iters\n)\nIf everything goes well you should see Compiling Stan program… and then Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains… followed by information on chains and iterations."
